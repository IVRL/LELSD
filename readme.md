# CLIPLSD: Project for EPFL Course Computational Photography: CS-413

Repository for CLIP-supervised GAN-based Image Editing.

### Streamlit apps

A streamlit app is provided to view the trained directions depending on the chosen parameters.

```
streamlit run 1D_visualization.py
```

Using this app you can view the edits made by the directions found by the model.
