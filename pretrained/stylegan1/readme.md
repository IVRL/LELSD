## How to download

Download the pretrained model
from [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qp3dOCNRSNWYJRzdcP6-npMbvFVUHUh4?usp=sharing).

You can also use [Awesome StyleGAN repo](https://github.com/justinpinkney/awesome-pretrained-stylegan) to download 
the pretrained models, but some models needs to be converted to match the naming in the code that we use.
